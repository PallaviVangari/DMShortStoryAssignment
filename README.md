# Understanding Zero-Shot Bilingual App Review Analysis
Welcome to this repository, where I delve into the fascinating topic of Zero-Shot Bilingual App Review Analysis. This is a personal exploration and explanation of a research paper that focuses on the use of large language models for analyzing app reviews in both English and French, without the necessity of training data specifically for each language.

### Overview
In this project, I aim to convey my understanding of how zero-shot learning can be effectively applied in the realm of natural language processing, particularly for bilingual app review analysis. This approach has significant implications for understanding user feedback across different languages and improving app functionalities based on diverse user inputs.
